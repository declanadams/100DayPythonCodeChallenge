# Write a program that works out whether if a given number is an odd or even number.
# Even numbers can be divided by 2 with no remainder.
# e.g. 86 is even because 86 รท 2 = 43
# 43 does not have any decimal places. Therefore the division is clean.
# e.g. 59 is odd because 59 รท 2 = 36.875
# 36.875 is not a whole number, it has decimal places. Therefore there is a remainder of 0.875, so the division is not clean.
# The modulo is written as a percentage sign (%) in Python. It gives you the remainder after a division.


number = int(input("Which number do you want to check?\n "))

if number % 2 == 0:
    print("this is an even number")

else:
    print("this is an odd number")
